# DesignPatterns
	Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. 
	Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. 
	These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.
	
	What is Gang of Four (GOF)?
	In 1994, four authors 
	Erich Gamma, 
	Richard Helm, 
	Ralph Johnson and 
	John Vlissides 
	published a book titled "Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" - which initiated the concept of Design Pattern in Software development.
	
	These authors are collectively known as Gang of Four (GOF). 
	According to these authors design patterns are primarily based on the following principles of object orientated design.
		1) 	Program to an interface not an implementation
		2)	Favor object composition over inheritance
		
	There are mainly three types of design patterns, which are further divided into their sub-parts:

	1.Creational Design Pattern: 
	These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, 
	rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. 
	This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
		Factory Pattern
		Abstract Factory Pattern
		Singleton Pattern
		Prototype Pattern
		Builder Pattern.

	2. Structural Design Pattern:
	These design patterns concern class and object composition. 
	Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
		Adapter Pattern
		Bridge Pattern
		Composite Pattern
		Decorator Pattern
		Facade Pattern
		Flyweight Pattern
		Proxy Pattern

	3. Behavioral Design Pattern:
	These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
		Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
		Command Pattern
		Interpreter Pattern
		Iterator Pattern
		Mediator Pattern
		Memento Pattern
		Observer Pattern
		State Pattern
		Strategy Pattern
		Template Pattern
		Visitor Pattern
